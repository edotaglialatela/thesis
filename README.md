The MATLAB script has been written by me for my bachelor degree in Continuum mechanics; it calculates the dynamical behaviour of a car under the effect of various types of forces, taking into the account the elastoplastic response of the dampeners. It also calculates the plastic strain.

The python script calculates the dynamical behaviour of the system shown in the DWG file, as well as useful informations of the vibrational analysis (modal forms, eigenvalues, ...).
